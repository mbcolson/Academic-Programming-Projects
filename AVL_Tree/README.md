# AVL Tree

In this Java programming project, an AVL tree was implemented with a GUI window to display the tree. 

## Background

An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree where for each node in the tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. For each node, there is a small red number displayed. This number is called the **balance factor**: height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree.
