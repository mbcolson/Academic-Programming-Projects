# XOR Linked List

In this C programming project, an XOR Linked-List was implemented.

## Background

An XOR Linked-List is a memory efficient doubly-linked list. Instead of storing pointers to the previous and next nodes in the list, it uses a single link field to traverse the list in both directions.
