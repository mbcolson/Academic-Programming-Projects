# Heap

In this C++ programming project, a binary max heap data structure was implemented as a class. A binary max heap is a tree-like data structure where each parent node's key is greater than or equal to it's child node's keys. A parent node can have at most two child nodes (this property is what makes it a binary heap). The heap class's public API consists of an Insert(), Retrieve(), isEmpty(), and isFull() methods.
