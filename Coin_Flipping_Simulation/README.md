# Coin Flipping Simulation

In this Java programming project, flipping a coin x number of times is simulated. The user picks the number of coin flips and then a GUI window displays the number of heads and tails in a bar graph. A psedo-random number generator is used to simulate a coin landing on heads or tails.
