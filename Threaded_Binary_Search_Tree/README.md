# Threaded Binary Search Tree

In this Java programming project, a double-threaded binary search tree was implemented with a GUI window to display the tree.

## Background

A double-threaded binary search tree is a type of BST where the nodes that contain a NULL left child and/or right child point to the inorder predecessor and inorder successor nodes (if they exist), respectively. These pointers (threads) allow for forward and reverse inorder traversals without using recursion or a stack.
